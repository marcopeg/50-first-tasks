# Setup TypeScript

## Goal

Configure TypeScript for the NodeJS project with proper type checking, compilation settings, and development workflow.

- Install TypeScript and @types/node
- Create tsconfig.json with appropriate compiler options
- Set up build scripts for development and production
- Configure source maps for debugging

## Plan

Strong with TypeScript, this project already is! Much accomplished, but complete the setup we must.

### Current State Analysis
- ✅ TypeScript dependencies installed (`typescript`, `@types/node`, `ts-node`)
- ✅ `tsconfig.json` configured with proper compiler options
- ✅ NPM scripts ready (`build`, `dev`, `start`)
- ✅ Source directory structure (`src/index.ts`) 
- ✅ ESLint configured for TypeScript files
- ✅ Prettier for TypeScript formatting

### Missing Elements to Complete
1. **Verify TypeScript compilation works**
   - Test `npm run build` command
   - Ensure `dist/` directory generates correctly
   - Validate source maps creation

2. **Enhance Development Workflow**
   - Add watch mode for development (`tsc --watch`)
   - Consider nodemon for auto-restart during development
   - Create development script that builds and runs

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update Memory Bank with TypeScript configuration details
   - Document the build process and development workflow
   - Add TypeScript best practices for the project

4. **Validation & Testing**
   - Test type checking works correctly
   - Verify ES2020 features work as expected
   - Ensure source maps function for debugging

### Implementation Steps
1. Test current TypeScript setup by running build and start commands
2. Add watch mode script if beneficial for development
3. Update Memory Bank documentation with TypeScript details
4. Mark task as completed once all verification passes

Mostly complete this task is! Verification and small enhancements, needed they are.

## Progress

**Step 1: Verifying TypeScript compilation works** ✅
- ✅ Tested `npm run build` - compiles successfully without errors
- ✅ Verified `dist/` directory generation with proper structure:
  - `index.js` - Compiled JavaScript
  - `index.js.map` - Source map for debugging
  - `index.d.ts` - Type declarations
  - `index.d.ts.map` - Declaration source map
- ✅ Tested `npm start` - compiled output runs correctly
- ✅ Tested `npm run dev` - TypeScript direct execution works with ts-node

**Step 2: Enhanced Development Workflow** ✅
- ✅ Added `build:watch` script for continuous compilation
- ✅ Added `dev:watch` script for development with auto-restart
- ✅ Verified type checking works with `tsc --noEmit`

**Step 3: Documentation Updates** ✅
- ✅ Updated Memory Bank DEPENDENCIES.md with enhanced TypeScript details
- ✅ Updated Memory Bank FEATURES.md with comprehensive TypeScript workflow documentation
- ✅ Documented build process and development workflow capabilities

**Step 4: Validation & Testing** ✅
- ✅ Confirmed type checking works correctly (no errors found)
- ✅ Verified ES2020 features are properly configured
- ✅ Ensured source maps function for debugging support
- ✅ All NPM scripts tested and working

**Task Status: COMPLETED** ✨

Strong with TypeScript, this project now is! Complete setup achieved:
- Full compilation workflow with source maps and declarations
- Enhanced development experience with watch modes
- Comprehensive documentation updated
- All validation tests passed successfully

Ready for ExpressJS setup, the project is!
